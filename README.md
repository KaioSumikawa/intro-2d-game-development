# intro-2d-game-development
This repository contains my projects and exercises developed during the 2D Game Development for Beginners course at Senac Registro, taught by professor Fabiano Albers. The main goal is to practice and apply the fundamentals of 2D game programming, including sprites, physics, collisions, animations, and basic gameplay mechanics.
